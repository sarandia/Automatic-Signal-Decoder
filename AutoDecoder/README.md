# Automatic-Signal-Decoder
Contains an automatic decoder and a Python wrapper for integration
Usage:
  1. Import autoDecode
  2. Create an autoDecode(wavfile) instance; wavfile is a string representing the path to the source audio file
  3. Call the run() method
  4. The caller program should wait for the decoding to finish or abort before exiting
  
Note: the `spacecraft/` directory should be copied to the current working directory from which the code is being run.
